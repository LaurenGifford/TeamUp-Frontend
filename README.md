### Functionality
After logging into the app, a Casting Director will create a new project by answering a series of project detail questionsa which will impact which models they have access to. Once the project has been created, Casting Directors will answer times questions regarding their desired model attributes. Models will be filtered to fit user preferences and can be hired to the project. Run out of time or have bad luck will the Agent Monster and the Casting Director's budget will suffer! Once all questions have been answered and models are hired, a Casting Director is taken to see all of their projects and models where they can then view and fire models.

### Frameworks
This project was created with a React frontend using JSON Web Token for Authentication. The backend is built witha RESTful Rails API and a Postgresql database.

### Getting Started
1. Fork and clone this frontend repo and its accompanying [backend](https://github.com/LaurenGifford/TeamUp-Backend) onto your local machine.
2. While in the frontend directory, run `npm install` in the terminal to ensure all necessary packages are installed.
3. Run `npm start` to start up a server listening on localhost:3001.
4. Complete backend setup specified in that repository.
5. Finally, if a browser tab has not already opened up, please visit localhost:3001 in browser to launch the app.
6. If you would prefer to skip the setup and directly view a running version, please checkout the deployed app on [Netlify](https://bookher.netlify.app/login)! 

### Next Steps
In subsequent versions of this app, we hope to create game prompts to inform the player of actions they should take to avoid penalties.
Feedback and contributions are welcomed.
